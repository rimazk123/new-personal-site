      <p>
        Hey! I'm Rimaz, a junior studying computer science at UMich. I'm
        interested in fullstack web development, which I've explored through my
        time as the Websites PM at the Michigan Daily and as an intern at
        Bandwidth. If you'd like to reach out professionally, please do so by
        sending me a connection request on LinkedIn.
      </p>
